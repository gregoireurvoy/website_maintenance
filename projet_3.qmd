# House prices predictions using machine learning models


The goal of this project was to build several models of varying complexity that can predict house prices. Then, we compare the results.

The dataset contains about 3000 observations (i.e. houses) and 82 attributes. We use the first 2500 observations to fit our models and estimate prices for the 500 others.
