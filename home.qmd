<p>

I am Grégoire Urvoy and I am research and teaching assistant at HEG Geneva. This site, developed with R, aims to share my work, professional and personal projects.

In a few words, I studied economics and finance at HEC Lausanne where I was research assistant for many years (in macro economics and marketing classes). I also hold a <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/education/continuing-education/applied-data-science-machine-learning/" target="_blank">certificate of open studies in applied data science from EPFL</a>. I am particularly interested in how to use applied statistical models in the fields of economics, sports, new technologies and video games. I mainly work with R and Python.

My competences in data science are mainly data collection, working with API, web scraping, data cleaning, analysis with statistics and machine learning, data visualization. I really like to get insights from data and the story telling around it.

In my life, I do triathlons, running and cycling. I love watching football and sport in general.
